Stratigraphy
============
Stratigraphy is a C++ library for reading Minecraft Anvil maps.
It relies on stupid endianness tricks, that I really should get rid of, but
don't know a proper way to implement them. I cannot garuntee that it will work
on any compiler/ system other that 64 bit Arch Linux with GCC 4.7.1.
